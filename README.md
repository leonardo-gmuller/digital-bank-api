`controllers`: methods for each endpoint

`database`: database related, including queries, connection, migrations

`middleware`: handlers for routes, for example: authentication

`models`: database entities, a mirror from the schema

`routes`: endpoints for API


## Endpoints
- `GET /accounts` - get a list of accounts
- `GET /accounts/{account_id}/balance` - get account balance
- `POST /accounts` - create an `Account`
- `POST /login` - authentic the user
- `GET /transfers` - gets the authenticated user's transfer list.
- `POST /transfers` - makes a transfer from one `Account` to another.

## Run Locally
First, set the environment variables (you can use `.env_template`), don't forget to configure a Postgres database.
```Bash
export ENVIRONMENT=local
export DEVELOPMENT=true

export DB_HOST=postgresdb
export DB_DRIVER=postgres
export DB_USER=root
export DB_PASSWORD=root
export DB_NAME=postgres
export DB_PORT=5432

export JWT_SECRET=my-secret-key`
```

## Run Tests

Check if you have Postgres running on your machine and check the environment variables to connect to the database you want to run the tests on.

- For test account: `go test -v src/tests/model_account_test.go`
- For test routes of accounts: `go test -v src/tests/accounts_test.go`
- For test routes of transfers: `go test -v src/tests/transfers_test.go`
- For test route of login: `go test -v src/tests/login_test.go`

## Build
